## Overview of the statistical analysis:

In order to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, Pandas was used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations was created to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results:
add images
and description under each

## Summary:
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
